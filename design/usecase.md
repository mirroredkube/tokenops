### 💡 **Use Case: MiCA-Compliant Token Registry**

#### 📝 One-Paragraph Use Case Definition:

> Traditional banks and fintechs in Europe are under increasing pressure to explore digital asset offerings, but lack the infrastructure to issue, manage, and report on tokenized assets in a secure, compliant way. The regulatory landscape — especially under the EU's MiCA framework — requires controlled issuance, KYC-bound access, and auditable lifecycle data, all while minimizing exposure to public crypto infrastructure.
>
> Our SaaS platform offers a **MiCA-compliant token registry**: a secure, API-first solution for institutions to create, manage, and monitor regulated digital tokens — including stablecoins, asset-backed instruments, or internal digital credits. It abstracts blockchain complexity through a ledger-agnostic backend (starting with XRPL or Hedera) and includes off-chain compliance layers for role-based access, identity integration, and audit reporting.

## ✅ 1. Key MVP Features

Here’s what your **Minimum Viable Product** needs to demonstrate to deliver value and win trust.

| Feature Group                       | MVP Feature                                                                                                                | Why It Matters                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Issuance**                  | Issue a regulated token (e.g. EUR-backed stablecoin, digital asset) with metadata (e.g. ISIN, compliance type, expiration) | Core value — turns existing assets into compliant tokens             |
| **Access Control**                  | Role-based dashboard (admin, auditor, viewer) + API key auth                                                               | Institutions need visibility, but with internal controls             |
| **Compliance Layer (off-chain)**    | Metadata + compliance rules (e.g., KYC flag, jurisdictional tag), mock KYC provider integration                            | Helps institutions simulate or prove MiCA-aligned token lifecycle    |
| **Audit & Reporting**               | Exportable CSV/JSON ledger activity + metadata logs (per token, per issuer)                                                | Easy to demo regulatory value even in test phase                     |
| **Ledger Adapter (XRPL or Hedera)** | Create + destroy tokens on-chain, view balances, record off-chain metadata                                                 | Keep core logic abstracted — enables multi-ledger later              |
| **Simple UI / Dashboard**           | Clean React UI to manage tokens, see issuance, trigger events                                                              | Banks expect interface-first tools — show value visually, not in CLI |

---

## 🧱 2. Architecture Overview

You’re building a **layer between the ledger and the institution** — not a wallet, not a protocol.

```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│     Your SaaS Dashboard/API│
└────────────────────────────┘
              │
      ┌───────┴────────┐
      │ Ledger Adapter │  <— handles XRPL or Hedera
      └───────┬────────┘
   ┌──────────┴────────────┐
   │   Token Engine Layer  │
   │ - Issue/revoke tokens │
   │ - Attach compliance   │
   │ - Generate reports    │
   └──────────┬────────────┘
        ┌─────┴───────┐
        │ Compliance  │   <— off-chain identity, KYC, audit logs
        │ Module      │
        └─────────────┘
```

Optional: Save metadata hashes on-chain if required for auditability.

## 🛠️ 3. Solo Build Plan (30–45 Days)

| Week | Deliverable                  | Focus                                                    |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Architecture + UI mockup     | Define flows (issue token, attach metadata, view/report) |
| 2    | XRPL or Hedera token adapter | Build simple create/burn/test flow                       |
| 3    | Dashboard + API auth         | User roles, issue tokens via UI                          |
| 4    | Compliance metadata + export | Attach metadata, mock KYC, downloadable logs             |
| 5    | Feedback + polish            | Share with early reviewers (bankers, fintech leads)      |

## ✅ MVP Success Criteria

* ✅ A token can be issued with metadata via your UI
* ✅ Access is controlled by user role
* ✅ Metadata can include compliance/KYC info
* ✅ A CSV report of all token events can be exported
* ✅ The ledger (XRPL/Hedera) is used under the hood, but abstracted
