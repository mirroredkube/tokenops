# North Star & Product USP (SaaS)

## North Star
Enable regulated organizations to **issue and operate tokens across multiple ledgers** with **one policy brain** and **explainable enforcement**, collecting **only the data required** for the selected region and scope.

## Positioning (One‑liner)
**One policy. Any ledger. Evidence on demand.**  
A regulation‑aware issuance control plane that turns complex rules (MiCA today, others tomorrow) into automated, auditable actions on XRPL, EVM, and more.

## USP Pillars
1. **Policy‑once, multi‑ledger enforcement** — Decide compliance off‑chain; enforce natively on each ledger (XRPL trustline auth; EVM allowlist gating). Avoid chain‑specific rewrites.
2. **Regulation‑aware & regulation‑agnostic** — MiCA + EU Travel Rule for MVP. Future regimes via a lightweight **Regulation Catalog** + **Policy Kernel**.
3. **Explainable decisions & evidence** — Every allow/deny/manual decision shows rationale, required documents, and an append‑only audit trail ready for auditors.
4. **Privacy by design** — Pseudonymous operational UI, identity vault separation, purpose‑based data collection, export redaction profiles.
5. **Operational automation** — Auto‑authorize trustlines or allowlists for KYC‑passed holders; humans handle exceptions with 4‑eyes.
6. **Enterprise‑simple** — Minimal nouns (Organization, Asset, Issuer Address), clear RBAC, evidence bundles.

## Ideal Customers
- Banks/EMIs/Fintechs (CASP/VASP) issuing **EMTs/ARTs**  
- Corporates issuing **utility/loyalty** tokens (Title II)  
- Tokenization providers needing multi‑ledger controls + auditor‑friendly posture

## Why Now
- MiCA & the EU Travel Rule are live; regulators expect non‑anonymous issuance, governed disclosures, and traceable controls.
- Native compliance knobs differ per ledger; teams need one consistent control plane.

## North‑Star Metrics (V0)
- Time from **Asset Draft → Activation**
- **Auto‑approval** rate (trustlines/allowlists)
- % Assets **Audit‑ready** (all required items satisfied)
- Manual review **queue time** & **exception rate**

## MVP Outcome
A credible, MiCA‑aware issuance MVP with XRPL + one EVM chain, regulation‑agnostic seams for fast expansion to new jurisdictions and ledgers.
