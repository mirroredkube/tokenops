    "whatIsRegula": {
      "question": "What is Regula?",
      "answer": "Regula is a compliance-grade tokenization platform that allows you to create assets, issue tokens, and manage authorizations with built-in compliance controls, audit trails, and role-based access. It supports multiple ledgers including XRPL, with Hedera and Ethereum coming soon."
    },
    "howToGetStarted": {
      "question": "How do I get started?",
      "answer": "To get started, first create an asset, then set up authorizations for holders, and finally use the issuance page to mint tokens. You can monitor all activity through the dashboard and export reports as needed."
    },
    "supportedLedgers": {
      "question": "What ledgers are supported?",
      "answer": "Currently, XRPL (XRP Ledger) is fully supported with asset creation, authorizations, and issuance. Hedera and Ethereum adapters are in development."
    },
    "assetsVsIssuances": {
      "question": "What's the difference between Assets and Issuances?",
      "answer": "Assets are the token definitions (like a currency code and metadata), while Issuances are the actual minting of tokens to specific addresses. You create an asset once, then can issue it multiple times to different holders."
    },
    "manageCompliance": {
      "question": "How do I manage compliance?",
      "answer": "Regula includes built-in compliance records, audit trails, and export capabilities. All transactions are logged and can be exported for audit purposes. Use the Compliance page to verify records and the Reports page to export data."
    },
    "integration": {
      "question": "Can I integrate with my existing systems?",
      "answer": "Yes, Regula provides RESTful APIs for programmatic access. Visit the API Documentation section to explore the complete API reference with interactive testing tools."
